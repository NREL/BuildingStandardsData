# Building Standards Data

This data library is a copy of the 90.1 standards data used in [OpenStudio Standards](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-standards/tree/master/lib/openstudio-standards/standards/ashrae_90_1) as an extension of the [OpenStudio SDK](https://www.openstudio.net/).

Data is provided in .json format and nested by standard.

Lighting, ventilation, and occupancy standard data is contained with openstudio standards space types, and follow the space type mappings as defined in the DOE Prototype Buildings.  The DOE prototype buildings are developed and maintained by PNNL and used in the savings determinations for 90.1.  Though unlikely, your specific use case may combine 90.1 space types in a different manner especially for uncommon building types and uses.

In the future, this repository may contain other building standards data.
